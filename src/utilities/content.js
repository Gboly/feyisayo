  `The first time I saw you, I gazed into your eyes and felt something, i didn't know what it was and i didn't think much about it. You were submitting your documents to the LGI for clearance. Corper wee! 😂`,
  `The next time I saw you, you were about to board a bus in front of the lga, i was going to join but realized it was full. so, I stepped aside. For whatever reason, a passenger alighted immediately and that was my chance to get on. Heard your voice for the first time during this trip 🙂. You asked for my money to serve as change. We alighted at the junction (eko hotel).`,
  `Where we had an actual conversation 😄. I asked if you were heading to your office as the direction you were heading was the path to my own office LOL. You replied "no" and that was the beginning of our "communication". We both boarded the same bus to our separate next destination. We continued the conversation which was very natural and easy.`,

  `Btw, i'm sure the other corpers in the bus where eavesdropping while forming unbothered 😂. I was going to get your number but my phone had died, so you decided to get mine instead.`,
  `We started texting after and i told my bro that i was going to be serious with you hahaha. Isn't that crazy? I barely even knew you 💀😂.`,
  `I remember our very first phone convesation. We spoke from about some minutes past 10pm till past 4am (almost Fajr). Damnnnnnn😍. This was the beginning of our "madness". We have never gone a day without speaking for at least an accumulation of 2hours.`,
  `Its been bliss so far. We've had a couple misunderstanding and we've been able to overcome them on the spot. I believe that's our super power.`,
  `Btw, how is a kwara man making your cheeks hurt from so much smiling? 💀`,
